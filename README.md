## 1. Vision & Architecture

Tessera is a Web3 financial infrastructure DAO network designed for global markets, focusing on the construction and expansion of AI × DeFi 4.0 architectures.

At its core, Tessera integrates the VEA (Value Equilibrium Algorithm) engine with an innovative option-driven mechanism, creating a self-adjusting system for asset issuance and circulation.

## 2. Dual-Core Token Economy

Tessera’s token model is built upon a dual-core structure composed of the governance token TSR and the algorithmic stablecoin USDY.

TSR serves as the governance and incentive medium of the ecosystem, with its issuance and redemption dynamically regulated by the VEA engine.

Powered by the V3 liquidity-pool architecture, Tessera achieves higher capital efficiency and lower slippage, enabling funds to flow seamlessly across different protocol modules while maintaining long-term market stability and economic balance.

## 3. Expanding Ecosystem

The Tessera ecosystem continues to evolve—integrating decentralized game-finance systems, on-chain identity frameworks, and real-world payment utilities.

A co-branded credit card program is also under development to bridge digital assets with real-world financial use cases.

Within the ecosystem, USDY is backed by multi-asset collateral and algorithmic stabilization, providing a sustainable store of value and settlement medium for all Tessera-based applications.

## 4. Governance & Global Vision

Through Fragmented Governance and global community collaboration, Tessera aims to build a decentralized and trustworthy financial foundation—advancing toward a new era of the Super-sovereign Settlement Network.
